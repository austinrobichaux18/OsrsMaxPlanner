    "Description": "This is a great method to learn after you have regular 3 ticking down. Once you�ve started the 3 tick cycle you�re able to continue it by eating roe / caviar. This means that you can continuously keep up the cycle without needing to drop fish. You also receive cooking xp for each fish you successfully cut, making this method more total xp/hr. You can�t start a 3 tick cycle by eating roe/caviar; if you mess up / the spot changes, you�ll need to herb tar or knife log again to start the cycle. Items are used at the top of the inventory as placeholders to allow the fish roe/caviar to predictably appear in the same inventory spot when cutting one fish. This also minimises mouse movement needed to perform the cycle when paired with a camera angle positioning the inventory closer to the fishing spot. It should be noted you do not have to worry about clicking the fish offcuts and then the fishing spot cancelling your cycle. You will always have the knife option 'use' active when you click the fish to cut or click where the offcuts are if you do not roll a catch.",

There's absolutely no wiggle room in these clicks, so be careful. Be sure your inventory contains no raw fish before restarting the method after a misclick. Clicking to drop burnt food is best done just before clicking the fishing spot. Firemaking gives a 4t skilling delay which can be used at the start of the method. This method is the fishing meta in f2p.",

    "Description": "Getting there: Fairy ring DJR and run south west. Trio rates are unconfirmed, possible it's higher for the 2 players on the West and East but poor rates for the South coast player. Duo can get above Jagex's polled xp/hr, 1 player on the West and 1 on East coast, this allows pools to be shared evenly between both players. Avoid worlds with random players in as your rates will drop. Gear: Full angler set (not a requirement), empty weapon, shield and gloves slot. A knife + bait. Get bait by picking up worms found on the island, then sustaining fish chunks by cutting fish you get while doing the method. Starting off: Pick up bird from Alry the Angler on the Island, click pools to catch fish+salamanders in exchange for Fishing + Hunter xp. Tactics: Stick to the coast area you're on, moving from West to the South for example will lower xp rates. Cast the bird to the nearest pools, prioritising those that are closest. Each pool lasts 7-12 seconds and will move once the bird has been cast to it. Cut fish whilst the bird is flying to a spot, avoid cutting or moving whilst the bird is in your hand as this will waste time gaining experience. Move up and down the shore whilst the bird is flying if you see clusters of pools closer to the shoreline further up/down.",

This method can be up to 137k+ fishing xp/hr with the use of a crystal harpoon, and around 125k/hr if only using a dragon harpoon. It is important to setup the rats exactly as shown in the video, and to be cautious when changing spots to prevent the rats from getting off cycle. How to afk if needed: You can't just click the spot to afk, you need get on cycle and then click once off cycle. You're free to then AFK until your inventory fills or the spot moves. It's also pretty easy to AFK and continue 2 ticking with chrome remote desktop.",

When dealing with the COLOSSAL WAVES (Don't tether unless you still have fish while depositing), fish 22-27 (This will vary depending on Tempoross's Essence but 24% should be low enough to deposit 27 fish), dump remaining fish, kill Tempoross, grab bucket.",

Barblore is currently the most macro-efficient way to train fishing. The method is similar to eat-cut barbarian fishing, but with the addition of making barbarian mixes and banking caviar for herblore experience. Fill your inventory with potions and leave at least 4 inventory spaces empty, and teleport to Otto�s Grotto. 3-tick fish similarly to eat-cut fishing, and use the caviar on 2-dose potions to make mixes while staying on cycle. Wear the highest-tier Rada�s blessing available for extra sturgeon. Once you have used up all your potions, fill your inventory with caviar and bank for more potions. You can increase trip length by bringing 4-dose potions and decanting them into 2-doses while fishing. To get the empty vials for decanting, you�ll need to withdraw 1 empty vial at the bank and empty the mixes while fishing. Making a mix, cutting a fish, emptying a potion, dropping and decanting a potion are all 0-tick actions. Doing these actions is only limited by your click speed and accuracy. Mixes count as food, so they can be drunk to continue the 3-tick cycle (similarly to eating roe). While learning, it�s recommended to leave more empty inventory space for the fish and not wear the Rada�s blessing. This makes it easier to keep up with making the mixes as your inventory won�t get full as fast. When you get more comfortable with the method, start wearing the Rada�s blessing for more sturgeon and bring 4-dose potions to use the decant method. You can also cut the trout and salmon for extra cooking experience.",
